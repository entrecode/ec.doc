# The Account Server

The Account Server handles authentication, authorization and account management.

# Authentication
Most API calls require authentication using an access token.

Access tokens are only issued to valid accounts on registered clients. 

To get an access token, a user has three options:

- login using a registered email address and password
- [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/v2.4)
- [Google OpenID Connect](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect)

In all cases, the user gets redirected back to the client with an access token. Depending on client configuration, the access token is appended to the URL query string or set as cookie.

The access token is a [JSON Web Token](http://jwt.io/) [[RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)] signed with RS512. The public RSA key can be obtained from the account server using the `ec:auth/public-key` relation for validation. The decrypted JWT contains the following information:

- `jti`: Token identifier (UUID)
- `sub`: Account ID (UUID)
- `email`: primary eMail address of the account
- `iss`: issuer ("entrecode")
- `iat`: timestamp (in seconds) the token was issued
- `exp`: expiration timestamp of the token (in seconds)

See [JWT libraries](http://jwt.io/#libraries) for JWT decoding and validating.

The issued access token has to be sent using the following HTTP Header:

To acquire an access token, auth/login for user credentials or auth/facebook or auth/google has to be called. See the Link Relation table of the Entry Point Resource for details.

## Client registration
Client registration is needed to obtain access tokens. Due to the authentication flow of OAuth, the end user is sent to the OAuth Provider in the browser, and afterwards redirected back to the client application. The access token can only be sent to the client using a valid redirect URL that gets the token appended as query string parameter or cookie.

Currently, clients can only be registered manually.
The following information is needed:

- `clientID`: Unique string identifier for the client. Has to be appended to requests.
- `callbackURL`: URL to send the user agent back to after success
- `config` (JSON):
    - `tokenMethod`: Specifies how the token is sent back to the client. Values: `query`, `cookie` or `body`. Can also be an array with multiple values. `body` only works with local Authentication (email/password). Default: `query`
    - `disableStrategies`: Disallow one or more login strategies for this client. Array containing any of `facebook`, `google`, `password`. Default: `null` (all strategies enabled)

`config` can contain a parameter `"tokenMethod": "cookie"` for the token to be sent as cookie. Default is `query`, so the token gets sent in the query string as `token` parameter.

Clients are expected to look for the token in that parameter and save it locally. Note that they should be stored into cookies instead of HTML 5 Local Storage due to security issues (XSRF attacks): [Where to Store Your JWTs](https://stormpath.com/blog/where-to-store-your-jwts-cookies-vs-html5-web-storage/)

# Authorization
entrecode uses a permission based authorization and permission system. Basically:

- accounts can be in any number of groups
- accounts as well as groups can have permissions
- account permissions are the sum of all permissions assigned directly to an account, as well as permissions assigned to any group the account is member of
- permissions are hierarchically organized in a [Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org/permissions.html)-like manner using [node shiro trie](https://github.com/entrecode/node-shiro-trie)

# Relations

Link Relation names are those registered with the [IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml). Additionally, custom link relations are used which are built in the form `https://doc.entrecode.de/en/latest/App_Manager/#link-relations/<relation>`. Those relations are also links to their own documentation (on this page). 
For brevity, [CURIE Syntax](http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) is used which results in relation names of the form `ec:<relation>/<optional_subrelation>`. 

Additional to the official link relations defined by [IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml) the App Manager uses the following:


| Link Relation             | Target Resource                               |Â Description |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|

|`ec:auth/public-key`| [Auth/PublicKey](resources/auth/#public-key)  | Public RSA key for validation of access token JWTs |
|`ec:auth/register`| [Auth/Signup](resources/auth/#signup) | Registration with email/password |

|`ec:auth/logout`|  | Invalidation of an access token |
|`ec:auth/password-reset`|  | Changing a registered password |

|`ec:auth/email-verification`|  | Verification link for email address |
|`ec:auth/facebook`|  | Login/Register using Facebook |
|`ec:auth/google`|  | Login/Register using Google |

|`ec:account/tokens`|  | Access Tokens of an account |
|`ec:account/token`|  | Single Access Token of an account |
