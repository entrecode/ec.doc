# Errors

Error responses across all APIs are always returned with an HTTP status code â‰¥ 400, i.e. 400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500.
The media type is `application/problem+json`. Error responses comply to the [Problem Details IETF Draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-07) *and* to [HAL](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-06).
 
JSON Schema: [https://schema.entrecode.de/schema-acc/error](https://schema.entrecode.de/schema-acc/error)

The following properties are REQUIRED:
 
* `status` is the HTTP status code of the error and the same status code as the actual HTTP response
* `code` is a four digit error code as defined below
* `title` is the generic, short description of the error code
* `type` is the URL to the description of the error code
* `_links` is a HAL link object that includes `up` and `describedby` link relations; `describedby` is the same URL as `type`.
 
The following properties are OPTIONAL:
 
* `detail` is the name of the object the error occurred on (e.g. the invalid property)
* `verbose` any additional information about the error
* `_embedded` is a HAL embed object that MAY include `error` sub-resources.
 
Error sub-resources can be used to indicate more errors that occurred or would have occurred, if the enclosing *main* error would not have occurred.
Error sub-resources have a subset of the properties described above: `code`, `title`, `type` and `detail`.

### Example

    {
        "status": 400,
        "code": 2202,        
        "title": "Missing property in query string",
        "type": "https://entrecode.de/doc/errors/2202",
        "detail": "count",
        "_links": {
            "up": {
                "title": "Data Manager Home Page",
                "href": "https://datamanager.entrecode.de" 
            },
            "describedby": {
                "title": "Error Description",
                "href": "https://entrecode.de/doc/errors/2202"
            }
        }
        "_embedded": {
            "error": {
                "code": 2201,
                "title": "Missing property in JSON Body",
                "type": "https://entrecode.de/doc/errors/2201",
                "detail": "property"
            }
        }
    }
    
    

## Error Codes
Error codes are 4 digit decimal codes.
They consist of two parts. The first number identifies the system the error occurred in, the last three numbers identify the error, they are the actual error codes.
Examples:

**2100:** A requested resource in the Datamanager does not exist.

**2202:** A request to a resource in the Datamanager misses a required property in its query string. The detail field of the error response will indicate which property.

**3000:** An internal error occurred in the Appserver, probably a server-side bug.
 
 
### First Number: System
 
|Code|System|
|---|---|
| 1xxx | Account Server |
| 2xxx | Data Manager |
| 3xxx | App Manager |
 
More Codes may be added in the future.
 
### Second Number: Error Code

The actual error code (`code`) is partitioned in error types (bold in the table below).
The `detail` field includes further information about the subject of the error.
The `verbose` field may be used for further information what is actually wrong with the subject in `detail`.

###*Guidelines for definition of new error codes*##
* *a suitable HTTP error code should still be used*
* *codes should be added to the defined error types (1xx-5xx)*
* *codes are logically sub-partitioned in groups of ten*
* *codes above x5x should be used for very (resource- or system-)specific errors*
