This documentation explains the core principles of entrecode's own systems. 

The core of it is the Data Manager, an API-based Database for web applications. 
It allows easy configuration of API resources and provides many useful features for validation. It's real-time features allow for event based actions upon data changes. Data Manager also supports file management of web assets, especially for (but not limited to) images.
Every Data Manager instance also allows easy setup of a user system with elaborated access control.

You can access entrecode's systems using the [Editor](https://e.entrecode.de).

Programmatic Access is most easily achieved using the [JavaScript SDK](https://entrecode.github.io/ec.sdk/).
