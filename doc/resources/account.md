## Create

To create a new Account Resource, the Signup process has to be executed. See `ec:auth/register` relation.

## Edit

To update an existing App Resource, clients may perform a PUT on `ec:app` or `self` at a single App Resource. The JSON Schema for editing an App is [https://entrecode.de/schema/account-template](https://entrecode.de/schema/account-template). 

All fields are optional and need their own permission. Fields where no permission is available will be ignored.

Permissions:

```
acc:edit:<uuid>:language,email,openid,password
acc:change-state:<uuid>
acc:set-permissions:acc:<uuid>
```

For setting permissions, additionally the permission `acc:permissions:<permission>` is needed.
The permission `acc:set-password:<uuid>` enables changing the password without the need for `oldPassword` to be set.

Deleting an OAuth / OpenID Connect connection is only allowed if `hasPassword` is true or an other connection which is not pending exists. Adding a connection is not possible via PUT, instead a signup has to be done with an authenticated access token.

Updating the password requires the two fields `oldPassword` and `newPassword`.

Editing the groups array is not possible using the Account Resource. Sending the property with a PUT request has no effect. To add accounts to a group, the group resource has to be edited.

*Note to deprecated `isPrincess` field: This field is not included anymore. Just add account to the `Princesses` group.*

The success status code is **200 OK** and the response body is the updated single App resource.

## Delete

Deletion is not possible at the moment. However, the `state` can be set to `deleted`.
